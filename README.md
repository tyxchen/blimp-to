Blimp.to
========

A game where the objective is to shoot down blimps on the screen.

Setup
-----

The game requires a screen size of at least 1280x720 to run. If this
requirement is not met, the game will exit with an error message. This
check can be turned off by commenting out lines 45-54 of Main.t, but
doing so runs the risk of scrollbars appearing in the game window.

Running the game requires a reasonably powerful processor in order to
handle Turing's CPU-heavy animations.

Instructions
------------

This is a keyboard-only game. Mouse input is not supported. Buttons can
be navigated through the arrow keys (selection) and the enter or space
keys to commit to that button.

Credits
